# Typescript

- Alternative to Javascript
- Typescript is a superset of Javascript. That means any valid Javascript code is also valid Typescript code.
- It allows us to use strict types.
- Supports modern features of Javascript such as `classes, arrow functions, and modules.`
- Extra features include `generics, interfaces, tuples` etc.
- Browsers do not understand Typescript. It needs to be compiled to Javascript at runtime.
